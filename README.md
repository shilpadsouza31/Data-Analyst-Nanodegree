# **Data Analyst Nanodegree**
This contains all the projects I have done as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program

## **Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends**
In this project, I have analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends of Bangalore to overall global temperature trends.

## **Project 2 - Tmdb Data Analysis**
In this project, I have analyzed movie data and provided insights on  what the data is telling us. Data was read and scrubbed to bring it to a state that would help meaningful analysis. Questions were framed basis the data and detailed answers with visual aids were provided. 

## **Project 3 - A/B Testing**
This project was aimed at helping an e-commerce company make a decision on whether or not to change a certain page (retain the old page or choose the new one). This was done using three methods to provide a concrete recommendation.
