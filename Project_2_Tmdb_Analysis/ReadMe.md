# Project 2 : Investigate TMDB Movies Dataset

## Project Overview
In this project, we had to analyze a dataset and then communicate our findings about it. 
I have used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to conduct and display my analysis.

## Introduction
I have used the TMDb movie database from Kaggle (further worked on by Udacity, for this project). 
This dataset is interesting as it has information on cast, budget, revenue, release dates and other such information for each title. 
It contains over 10,000 titles and is a community built database.

## Why this Project?
I chose this dataset as the data seemed to need scrubbing even on first glance. 
I knew I would have to use functions within the libraries to clean the data and hence found this to be challenging and fun!

## Key learnings from this project:
- Carried out end to end data analytics
- Ability to pose the right questions from a given data set
- Wrangle the data into a usable format 
- Understood how to use functions, which are built into the Python libraries
- Good grip on using NumPy and Pandas 
- Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visually communicate the results of the analysis 
- Able to draw meaningful conclusions from the dataset
