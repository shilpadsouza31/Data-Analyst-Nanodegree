# Project 3: Analyze A/B Test Results
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
Some descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to the data set in order to drive conclusions from the data set. 
In the end, a logistic regression model was built in order to help understand what drives conversions.
